%% Assignment 1B Scenario 1: Narrowband beamformers
%
%   Implement tools for narrowband beamformer design and evaluation
%   Result plots: sensor locations, beampatterns in plot format.
%   Note:   Each step uses different functions of the beamformermer class.
%           These functions are denoted with each step.
